# Plant-Disease-Detection
This repository contains a deep learning-based project for detecting plant diseases from leaf images. The goal of this project is to leverage convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to accurately identify various diseases affecting plants, enabling early intervention and potentially saving crops from widespread damage.
